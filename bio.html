        <h2 class="bioPageSubtitle">Early Life</h2>
        <h3 class="bioPageText">Growing up in Norton, Massachusetts, I was an only child with two loving parents. 
            I always loved playing with legos which eventually sparked my creativity as a child. As I grew up, I 
            played lots of Minecraft which only added to my creative side. Along side my hobbies, I also played 
            soccer which made me become a very competitive person who always wants to do better.</h3>
